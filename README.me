A Discord bot for generating message stats for users.

This bot (You have to set one up) generates a CSV file containing cumulative message count data for every member that has joined any given server.
Think of it as if you continuously searched "from: User#0000 before:1970-01-01", adding 1 day to the date each time, but for every
single member in your server, including bots.

You can then import the CSV file into a program like flourish.studio's Bar Chart Race template to create an interactive timeline of
the top users sorted by messages they have sent, from the birth of your server until present day.
